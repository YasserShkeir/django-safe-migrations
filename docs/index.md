# Django Safe Migrations

Detect unsafe Django migrations before they break production.

## What is Django Safe Migrations?

Django Safe Migrations is a static analysis tool for Django migrations. It scans your migrations and warns you about operations that could cause:

- **Table locks** that block reads/writes
- **Downtime** during deployments
- **Data loss** from unsafe drops
- **Application errors** from schema/code mismatches

## Quick Example

```bash
$ python manage.py check_migrations

Found 1 migration issue(s):

ERROR [SM001] myapp/migrations/0002_add_email.py:15
   Adding NOT NULL field 'email' to 'user' without a default value will lock the table
   Operation: AddField(user.email)

   Suggestion:
      1. Add field as nullable first
      2. Backfill existing rows
      3. Add NOT NULL constraint in separate migration
```

## Why Use This?

| Without Safe Migrations                         | With Safe Migrations       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Deploy, find out table is locked for 10 minutes | Get warned before merge    |
| Roll back, scramble to fix                      | Fix with suggested pattern |
| Angry users, lost revenue                       | Happy users, smooth deploy |
